# character_talk

Simple library for showing rectangles with text/character lines in a video game.

## Getting Started

Using the library is fairly straightforward.  Simply call ```CharacterTalk().getSpeechDisplay(context, "What to say")``` and you will get a floating box that you can place like any other Flutter widget.

## Future Items
In the future it will be cool to add some properties to the ```CharacterTalk``` class itself to make the speech rectangles more customizable.
