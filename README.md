# character_talk

Simple library for showing rectangles with text/character lines in a video game.

## Getting Started

Using the library is fairly straightforward.  Simply call ```CharacterTalk.getSpeechDisplay(context, "What to say")``` and you will get a floating box that you can place like any other Flutter widget.
